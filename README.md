## Core Concepts

### Japanese Typography

kiso.css is built to handle Japanese text gracefully. It automatically adjusts spacing between Japanese and alphanumeric characters (`text-autospace`), refines line breaks (`line-break: strict`), and handles punctuation spacing (`text-spacing-trim`), which are often overlooked in other reset libraries.

### Zero Specificity

By wrapping selectors in `:where()`, kiso.css keeps specificity at zero. This means you can easily override any style with your own classes or element selectors without resorting to `!important` or complex selectors.

```css
/* This will easily override kiso.css without any specificity issues */
a {
  color: red;
}
```

### Accessibility by Default

Accessibility is a core principle. For example, lists remain recognizable by screen readers (`list-style-type: ""`), and focus rings are enhanced for better visibility (`:focus-visible`).

### Selective Reset

We avoid "over-resetting." Useful UA styles like `font-weight` on headings, `padding` on buttons, and borders on tables are preserved to reduce the amount of code you need to write. Destructive resets like `appearance: none` are avoided.
